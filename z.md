PAYMENT OPERATIONS
SALE request
Payment Platform supports two main operation type: Single Message System (SMS) and Dual Message 
System (DMS).
SMS is represented by SALE transaction. It is used for authorization and capture at a time. This operation 
is commonly used for immediate payments.
DMS is represented by AUTH and CAPTURE transactions. AUTH is used for authorization only, without 
capture. This operation used to hold the funds on card account (for example to check card validity).
SALE request is used to make both SALE and AUTH transactions.
If you want to make AUTH transaction, you need to use parameter auth with value Y.
If you want to send a payment for the specific sub-account (channel), you need to use channel_id, that 
specified in your Payment Platform account settings.
This request is sent by POST in the background (e.g. through PHP CURL).

GET_TRANS_STATUS_BY_ORDER request
Gets the status of the most recent transaction in the order's transaction subsequence from Payment 
Platform. This request is sent by POST in the background (e.g. through PHP CURL).
It is recommended to pass an unique order_id in the payment request. That way, it will be easier to 
uniquely identify the payment by order_id. This is especially important if cascading is configured. In this 
case, several intermediate transactions could be created within one payment.

RECURRING_SALE request
Recurring payments are commonly used to create new transactions based on already stored cardholder 
information from previous operations.
RECURRING_SALE request has same logic as SALE request, the only difference is that you need to 
provide primary transaction id, and this request will create a secondary transaction with previously used 
cardholder data from primary transaction.
This request is sent by POST in the background (e.g. through PHP CURL).

Formula 2
Appendix A (Hash)
Hash - is signature rule used either to validate your requests to payment platform or to validate callback 
from payment platform to your system. It must be md5 encoded string calculated by rules below:
Formula 1:
hash is calculated by the formula:
md5(strtoupper(strrev(email).PASSWORD.strrev(substr(card_number,0,6).substr(card_number,-
4))))
if parameter card_token is specified hash is calculated by the formula:
md5(strtoupper(strrev(email).PASSWORD.strrev(card_token)))
Formula 2:
hash is calculated by the formula:
md5(strtoupper(strrev(email).PASSWORD.trans_id.strrev(substr(card_number,0,6).substr(card_nu
mber,-4))))
Formula 3:
hash for Create a schedule is calculated by the formula:
md5(strtoupper(strrev(PASSWORD)));
Formula 4:
hash for Other schedules is calculated by the formula:
md5(strtoupper(strrev(schedule_id + PASSWORD)));
Formula 5:
hash for CREDIT2CARD request is calculated by the formula:
md5(strtoupper(PASSWORD.strrev(substr(card_number,0,6).substr(card_number,-4))))
if card_token is specified hash is calculated by the formula:
md5(strtoupper(PASSWORD. strrev(card_token)))
Formula 6:
hash is calculated by the formula:
md5(strtoupper(PASSWORD.trans_id.strrev(substr(card_number,0,6).substr(card_number,-4))))
Formula 7:
hash is calculated by the formula:
md5(strtoupper(strrev(email).PASSWORD.order_id.strrev(substr(card_number,0,6).substr(card_nu
mber,-4)))
